## Master's Thesis


Not published.

*In this thesis we prove the Van de Ven theorem: if $X$ is a closed subvariety of $\mathbb{P}^n.$ The short exact sequence*

$$0 \longrightarrow \mathscr{T}_X \longrightarrow \mathscr{T}_{\mathbb{P^n}}|_X \longrightarrow \mathscr{N}_{X|\mathbb{P}^n} \longrightarrow 0$$

*splits if and only if $X$ is linear. We will recall standard results about algebraic groups, following Borel, before tackling the Matusmura-Oort and Borel-Remmert theorems. Finally, we will prove the Van de Ven problem by following the work of Mustaţă and Popa.*
